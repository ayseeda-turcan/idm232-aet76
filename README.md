An online cookbook featuring a library of recipes.

## Overview
This is a custom PHP-based online cookbook that allows users to browse, search, and view recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.  
This project was created for my web development course to demonstrate my skills in front-end design and back-end development using PHP and MySQL.

The site is fully responsive and designed with an accessible, user-friendly layout that adapts from mobile to desktop screens.
